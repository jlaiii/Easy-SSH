# SSH into a server using PowerShell
This PowerShell script allows you to easily connect to a server using Secure Shell (SSH) protocol. Before running the script, make sure that OpenSSH is installed on your system. If it is not installed, the script will install it for you.

## Usage
To use this script, simply run it from a PowerShell prompt. The script will prompt you for a username, server address, and port number. Once you have entered this information, it will establish an SSH connection to the specified server.
